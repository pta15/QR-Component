## My process

Utilizing HTML and SCSS, I developed a QR card component by adhering to the provided style guide and populating the SCSS file with corresponding variables. I initially established a basic framework in HTML before dedicating time to refining the component to closely resemble the design images I received. Furthermore, I made certain that the component was responsive, ensuring its adaptability to various screen sizes for optimal viewing experiences.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass/SCSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project was relatively uncomplicated and closely aligned with my previous experiences. Incorporating SCSS into my work was certainly a novel experience, as I had not previously utilized Sass. However, I quickly understood its appeal and the reasons behind its widespread endorsement. The ability to employ variables in my CSS facilitated a more cohesive design approach, and I anticipate that these variables will prove increasingly beneficial as other projects expands in scope.
